review of previous day and brainstorming what to do now.

# Trying to run a BERT model on the conversation

I looked into my code from the previous year and try to adapt it to my current problem.

Instead I found a paper "Label Agnostic Pre-training for Zero-shot Text Classification"
https://github.com/ChrisIsKing/zero-shot-text-classification/tree/master; on hugging face
sadly the corresponding google drive was taken offline and can no longer be accessed

Other options include training the model myself or find another good alternative. Zero-shot inference would be
preferable but may not be realistic..
Primary dataset for training is Yelp Dataset Challenge in 2015
